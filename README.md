# Project
The project contained in this folder seems to be the absolute v. relative path
class example from last semester in your class. Basically the first things you gave
us. It is an image of a file structure with various questions at the bottom.

## Learned so far
So far we have learned alot with git. We have learned how to make branches, make changes on those branches, stage the changes, and commit those changes. We can also create remote repositories on gitHub and connect to them through the terminal. We can push and pull to and from those repositories. We can work on different branches within a team setting to work on different projects.
